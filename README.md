# US GV Dashboard

Welcome to the **US Gun Violence (GV) Dashboard**, I developed this using the [R Statistical programming language](https://www.r-project.org/) as a personal project to investigate gun violence incidents in my home city of Philadelphia and the United States at large. 
The *User Guide* tab will describe many of the same details, techniques, and assumptions as below.

### Data Sources

The Dashboard takes in data from a few main sources:

- [Gun Violence Archive](https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/)
  - The GVA is one of the most reputable and reliable data sources for GV to date. Data is updated, scraped, and refreshed live from this site.
- [Mass Shooting Tracker](https://massshootingtracker.org/)
  - The MST database is an open source, crowd-supported dataset with a slightly larger pool than GVA. The dataset was saved and frozen shortly before it was discontinued from its original location and has yet to be reinstated from October 2019.

### Definitions & Assumptions

**United States Gun Violence:**
- The District of Columbia (D.C.) as a standalone district was excluded due to the high incidence per capita. In the normalization graphs D.C. had a density of over 5 which heavily skewed the graph.
- A “Mass Shooting” is being defined as “a single outburst in which four or more people are shot.” For reference, the FBI defines a “mass murder” as “four or more murdered during an event with no”cooling-off period" between the murders." The definitions have changed over the years and the U.S. acknowledges that there is no agreed upon definition at present.
- Only data taken from 2013 to the present is accounted for due to a lack of resources from before this year and varying definitions for what constitutes a mass shooting as time has gone on since.
